IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) has been enhanced in version 7.0.10.0 to enable it to be deployed on cloud native hosting platforms.
While SPM could be cloud hosted in a IaaS cloud delivery model, this model cannot leverage the benefits of flexibility, elasticity, efficiency
and the strategic value that is offered by cloud native architecture.

This runbook shows you how to containerize an instance of SPM and deploy it on a Kubernetes environment, using Minikube or IBM Cloud Kubernetes
Service (IKS).

This runbook also covers OpenShift, specifically CodeReady Containers (CRC), for development purposes. However, this deployment option should be
considered as a preview, as SPM does not provide official support of OpenShift.

Figure 1 shows how SPM is built as a containerized application by using WebSphere® Application Server Liberty, packaged as Docker®
containers, orchestrated by Helm, and running on IKS.

**Note:** Database support and MQ support remains on virtual machines (VMs) as part of the initial offering.

Containerization makes it easier for developers to develop, deploy, and operate applications by simplifying the packaging and deployment process.
To support containerized architectures, a number of architectural changes were made. The changes are documented below and apply only to SPM running on
Kubernetes.

* [Message Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubJMSArchitecture.html)
  When IBM® Cúram Social Program Management is containerized, IBM MQ Long Term Support (LTS) is used as the message engine to process internal application
  JMS-based deferred processing.
* [Transaction Isolation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubThreadIsolation.html)
  Client HTTP initiated transactions and JMS initiated transactions run on different WebSphere Application Server Liberty instances, integrated through
  an external message engine (for example, IBM MQ).
* [Elasticity](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubElasticity.html)
  Elasticity in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is the ability to scale up or down pods and nodes to adjust to the load to meet the end user demand.
