## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is an open source tool that creates, deploys, and runs applications by using containers.
Install Docker by following the instructions in [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/). You can follow this runbook by using any Docker edition, including the community edition.

**Note:** The following Docker versions were used to verify this runbook:

* Docker Engine: 19.03
* Docker Desktop for Windows: 2.1.0.5
* Docker Desktop for Mac: 2.2.0.3

## Kubernetes and Minikube

<InlineNotification>

As of Release 20.7.0, the Kubernetes version used to verify this runbook is 1.18.

Kubernetes (which is also referred to as "K8s" and is described at a high-level on the [Kubernetes home page](https://kubernetes.io/)) is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
You will use the command-line tool, `kubectl`, extensively when you follow the steps that are described in this runbook. The `kubectl` download and installation steps are described on [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

Minikube is a variant of Kubernetes that runs a single-node cluster inside a virtual machine (VM) on your laptop. See [next page](/01-prereq/minikube) for Minikube configuration details for SPM.

**Note:** The following versions were used to verify this runbook:

* kubectl: 1.18
  **Important**: Take note of the version used. This will be required when creating a new Minikube environment.
* Minikube: 1.12

## Helm V3

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** As of Release 20.7.0, the Helm version used to verify this runbook is 3.2. All the Helm commands that are used in this runbook are based on Helm v3.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager that helps you to find, share, and use software that is built for Kubernetes.
Helm streamlines the installation and management of Kubernetes applications, and is the equivalent of the apt, yum, or homebrew utilities for Kubernetes.

Helm uses a packaging format called Chart. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.
A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or a complex deployment, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, and caches.
Charts are created as files laid out in a particular directory tree, then they can be packaged into versioned archives for deployment. For more information, see the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/).

This runbook uses Helm Charts and describes how to package and deploy them. For more information, see [Preparing Helm Charts](/04-deployment/hc_preparation).

Install Helm by following the steps described in [Helm install](https://github.com/helm/helm#install).
