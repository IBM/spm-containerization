## What is CRC?

CodeReady Containers (CRC) is a minimal, preconfigured OpenShift 4.1 or newer cluster designed to run on your local workstation as a development environment for OpenShift.
For more information, see [CodeReady Containers](https://github.com/code-ready/crc).

Similar to Minikube in concept, CRC provides a cloud like environment locally, to create and deploy an OpenShift cluster for development and testing purposes.

Here, we will cover some common CRC operations, including deploying SPM to the CRC environment. We will be using the same helm charts produced in the previous [Preparing Helm charts](/04-deployment/hc_deployment) section.

For a full getting started guide for CRC, see [Getting Started Guide CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.8/html/getting_started_guide/index)

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  Cúram SPM does not provide official support of OpenShift. All the references to OpenShift and CRC should be considered as an Early Adopter Release.

</InlineNotification>

**System Requirements**:

Detailed system requirements can be found [in the CRC documentation](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#minimum-system-requirements_gsg).
CRC needs to be able to allocate a minimum of 9GB RAM to its VM.
It is recommended your workstation have at least 16GB to operate, some workloads may require more.

## Installation of CRC

You will need to create an account at [RedHat Cloud](https://www.redhat.com/).

Create a `$CRC_HOME` folder to use for the purposes of the installation.
Download the installation archive from [latest release](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned) to `$CRC_HOME` and extract the archive.
On the same page download your pull secret to `$CRC_HOME`. At the time of writing the `latest release` is `1.10.0`.

```shell
tar -xvf crc-macos-amd64.tar.xz
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  Here we have two options, add the binary to the `PATH` environment variable, or move it to `/usr/local/bin/`

</InlineNotification>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Add to the PATH">
<Row>
<Column>

`export PATH=$CRC_HOME/crc-macos-1.10.0-amd64:$PATH`

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>

<Tab label="/usr/bin/local ">
<Row>
<Column>

`mv $CRC_HOME/crc-macos-1.10.0-amd64/crc /usr/local/bin`

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Whichever option you choose, you should now have crc in your executable path, to test this run:

```shell
crc version
```

The output should be similar to:

```
crc version: 1.10.0+9025021
OpenShift version: 4.4.3 (embedded in binary)
```

## Setting up CRC

The first step is to configure the prerequisites for the OpenShift cluster, including taking control of your hosts and resolver files to provide access to the CRC cluster.
To do this run the following command, providing the workstation administrator password as required.
This procedure will also create the ~/.crc directory if it does not already exist.

```shell
crc setup
```

Now that the basic configuration is complete, we can edit the configuration further to change the memory limit and add the path to the pull secret file downloaded previously.
We will also set the cpus to 6:

```shell
crc config set memory 32768
crc config set cpus 6
crc config set pull-secret-file $CRC_HOME/pull-secret.txt
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  While CRC's minimum memory allocation requirement is 8GB, only a single replica Curam deployment can be achieved using this.
We suggest you allocate as many resources as available.
The greater the workload the greater the memory and processor requirements.
Any changes to the crc config require you to delete the cluster and start a new one.

</InlineNotification>

You can always check the configured options of ’crc’ with:

```shell
crc config view
```

After setup is complete, the cluster could be started with 6 CPUs.

```shell
crc start
```

This will output something similar to:

```
level=info msg="Checking if oc binary is cached"
...
...
...
level=info msg="To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following 'crc oc-env' instructions"
level=info msg="Then you can access it by running 'oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'"
level=info msg="To login as an admin, run 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p YourPassWordHere https://api.crc.testing:6443'"
...
...
```

Please note the `kubeadmin` and `developer` credentials for later use.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  For the rest of the guide you can substitute the credentials you received when you started your cluster for $KUBEADMN_PSWD and $KUBEDEVEL_PSWD.
Alternatively these credentials will be returned by the `crc console --credentials` commands.
This guide will be using $KUBEDEVEL_PSWD and $KUBEADMN_PSWD environment variables.
You may find it convenient to to the same, so you can copy and paste commands without having to switch values:

`export KUBEADMN_PSWD=yourKubeAdminPassword`

`export KUBEDEVEL_PSWD=yourKubeDeveloperPassword`

</InlineNotification>

Next we will set up the OpenShift Client `oc` which is used to administer the CRC cluster by running the following two commands:

```shell
crc oc-env
eval $(crc oc-env)
```

If required, you can stop the cluster using:

```shell
crc stop
```

Or delete it using:

```shell
crc delete
```

## Creating a CRC project

We will create a project for our SPM deployment, again we will use an environment variable for added convenience when following the guide.

Create the environment variable, you can set to value to anything you like, but it should consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'my-name',  or '123-abc"):

```shell
export releasename="spm-deploy"
```

Login as kubeadmin:

```shell
oc login -u kubeadmin -p $KUBEADMN_PSWD https://api.crc.testing:6443
```

Create the project:

```shell
oc adm new-project $releasename
```

And switch kubernetes context to the new project:

```shell
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace $releasename
```

## Deployment Process

Creation of a Security Context Constraint (SCC).
This SCC allows DB2 and MQ images to run as they require certain permissions, which are by default blocked in OpenShift.

We have provided a shell script to configure the SCC, located at `$SPM_HOME/helm-charts/spm/prereqs` apply the policy by running the script as follows:

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts/spm/prereqs
./createSCC.sh -n $releasename
```

Enable the Image Registry default route

```shell
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'

```

Add relevant roles to user

```shell
oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry
oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer kube:admin
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user registry-viewer kube:admin
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  This will overwrite any existing policy with the same name.

If policy already exists, add system:serviceaccount:${releasename}:default to the users array in the policy by editing the policy YAML or running the command below:

`oc adm policy add-scc-to-user spm-dev-scc -z system:serviceaccount:${releasename}:default`

</InlineNotification>

Once ran, you can verify that the SCC for SPM has been created:

```
kubectl get scc
NAME               AGE
anyuid             1d
hostaccess         1d
hostmount-anyuid   1d
hostnetwork        1d
node-exporter      1d
nonroot            1d
privileged         1d
restricted         1d
spm-dev-scc        1m
```
