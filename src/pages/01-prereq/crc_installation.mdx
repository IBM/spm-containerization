## What is CRC?

CodeReady Containers (CRC) is a minimal, preconfigured OpenShift 4.1 or newer cluster that is designed to run on your local workstation as a development environment for OpenShift.
For more information, see [CodeReady Containers](https://github.com/code-ready/crc).

Similar to Minikube in concept, CRC provides a cloud like environment locally to create and deploy an OpenShift cluster for development and testing purposes.

This page covers some common CRC operations, including deploying SPM to the CRC environment. You will use the helm charts produced in [Preparing Helm charts](/04-deployment/hc_deployment).

For a full getting started guide for CRC, see [Getting Started Guide CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.8/html/getting_started_guide/index)

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  SPM does not provide official support of OpenShift. All the references to OpenShift and CRC should be considered as an Early Adopter Release.

</InlineNotification>

**System Requirements**:

You can find detailed system requirements in the [CRC Getting Started Guide](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#minimum-system-requirements_gsg).
CRC must be able to allocate a minimum of 9GB RAM to its VM.
Your workstation should have at least 16GB to operate, some workloads may require more.

## Installing CRC

Create an account at [RedHat Cloud](https://www.redhat.com/).
Create a `$CRC_HOME` folder to use for the purposes of the installation.
Download the installation archive from [latest release](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned) to `$CRC_HOME` and extract the archive.
On the same page, download your pull secret to `$CRC_HOME`. At the time of writing the `latest release` is `1.13.0`.

```shell
tar -xvf crc-macos-amd64.tar.xz
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  You have two options, add the binary to the `PATH` environment variable, or move it to `/usr/local/bin/`.

<Tab label="Add to the PATH">
<Row>
<Column>

`export PATH=$CRC_HOME/crc-macos-1.10.0-amd64:$PATH`

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>

<Tab label="/usr/bin/local ">
<Row>
<Column>

`mv $CRC_HOME/crc-macos-1.10.0-amd64/crc /usr/local/bin`

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Whichever option you choose, you should now have crc in your executable path, to test this run the following command:

```shell
crc version
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```
crc version: 1.10.0+9025021
OpenShift version: 4.4.3 (embedded in binary)
```

## Setting up CRC

The first step is to configure the prerequisites for the OpenShift cluster, including taking control of your hosts and resolver files to provide access to the CRC cluster.
To do this run the following command, providing the workstation administrator password as required.
This procedure also creates the ~/.crc directory if it does not already exist.

```shell
crc setup
```

Now that the basic configuration is complete, edit the configuration to change the memory limit and add the path to the pull secret file downloaded previously.

To set the CPUs to 6, run the following command:

```shell
crc config set memory 32768
crc config set cpus 6
crc config set pull-secret-file $CRC_HOME/pull-secret.txt
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  While CRC's minimum memory allocation requirement is 8GB, only a single replica SPM deployment can be achieved using this.
You should allocate as many resources as are available.
The greater the workload the greater the memory and processor requirements.
Any changes to the crc config require you to delete the cluster and start a new one.

</InlineNotification>

You can always check the configured options of ’crc’, run the following command:

```shell
crc config view
```

After setup is complete, start the cluster with 6 CPUs, run the following command:

```shell
crc start
```

This outputs something similar to the following:

```
level=info msg="Checking if oc binary is cached"
...
...
...
level=info msg="To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following 'crc oc-env' instructions"
level=info msg="Then you can access it by running 'oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'"
level=info msg="To login as an admin, run 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p YourPassWordHere https://api.crc.testing:6443'"
...
...
```

Note the `kubeadmin` and `developer` credentials for later use.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  For the rest of the guide you can substitute the credentials you received when you started your cluster for $KUBEADMN_PSWD and $KUBEDEVEL_PSWD.
Alternatively, these credentials are returned by the `crc console --credentials` command.
This guide uses $KUBEDEVEL_PSWD and $KUBEADMN_PSWD environment variables.
You may find it convenient to to the same, so you can copy and paste commands without having to switch values:

`export KUBEADMN_PSWD=yourKubeAdminPassword`

`export KUBEDEVEL_PSWD=yourKubeDeveloperPassword`

</InlineNotification>

Next, set up the OpenShift Client `oc`, which is used to administer the CRC cluster:

```shell
crc oc-env
eval $(crc oc-env)
```

If required you can stop the cluster:

```shell
crc stop
```

Or delete the cluster:

```shell
crc delete
```

## Creating a CRC project

Create a project for the SPM deployment, again use an environment variable for your convenience when following the guide.

Create the environment variable, you can set to value to anything you like, but it should consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'my-name',  or '123-abc"):

```shell
export releasename="spm-deploy"
```

Login as kubeadmin:

```shell
oc login -u kubeadmin -p $KUBEADMN_PSWD https://api.crc.testing:6443
```

Create the project:

```shell
oc adm new-project $releasename
```

Switch kubernetes context to the new project:

```shell
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace $releasename
```

## Deployment Process

Creation of a Security Context Constraint (SCC).
This SCC allows DB2 and MQ images to run as they require certain permissions, which are by default blocked in OpenShift.

You can find a shell script to configure the SCC located at `$SPM_HOME/helm-charts/spm/prereqs`.
Apply the policy by running the following script:

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts/spm/prereqs
./createSCC.sh -n $releasename
```

Enable the Image Registry default route:

```shell
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'

```

Add relevant roles to user:

```shell
oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry
oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer kube:admin
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user registry-viewer kube:admin
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  This step overwrites any existing policy that has the same name.

If policy already exists, add system:serviceaccount:${releasename}:default to the users array in the policy by editing the policy YAML or by running the following command:

`oc adm policy add-scc-to-user spm-dev-scc -z system:serviceaccount:${releasename}:default`

</InlineNotification>

You can verify that the SCC for SPM has been created:

```
kubectl get scc
NAME               AGE
anyuid             1d
hostaccess         1d
hostmount-anyuid   1d
hostnetwork        1d
node-exporter      1d
nonroot            1d
privileged         1d
restricted         1d
spm-dev-scc        1m
```
