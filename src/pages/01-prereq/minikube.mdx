Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine (VM) on your laptop, for users who want to try out Kubernetes or develop with it.
Minikube documentation is available at [Installing Kubernetes with Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/).
The following sections are not a substitute for the official documentation but they get you started in a classic configuration.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Minikube version used to verify this runbook: 1.12

</InlineNotification>

The following installation steps are described:

* Installing Minikube
* Setting up the Docker® registry
* Configuring the hosts file for Minikube
* Starting Minikube
* Enabling Helm for Minikube
* A summary of some useful Minikube commands

## Minikube installation

Minikube installation steps are described in the official documentation for your preferred Operating System: [Install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

## Starting Minikube

Minikube can be started with a command as simple as `minikube start` without any additional parameters. However, the resulting VM will be too small to deploy an instance of SPM, so several other parameters are required:

```shell
minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox --cpus 4 --memory 8G --insecure-registry "192.168.0.0/16" --disk-size='30G' --kubernetes-version v1.18.6
```

Where `192.168.0.0/16` is the subnet that contains the IP address that is assigned to the Minikube VM. You can verify the IP address by using the `minikube ip` command.

The IP address might vary depending on your development environment. Therefore, start a Minikube instance to get the IP address and then delete it
and restart it with the start command. See the note in [Specifying the insecure registry](#specifying-the-insecure-registry).

### Specifying the resource allocation

You can add properties to specify the resource allocation. For example:

* `--cpus 4` to use 4 CPUs
* `--memory 8G` to use 8 GB of RAM
* `--disk-size=30G` to use 30 GB of disk space

### Specifying the VM driver

Add the `--vm-driver=` option to the `minikube start` command to specify the underlying virtual machine driver. The following drivers were tested:

* `--vm-driver=virtualbox` - VirtualBox on OSX and Windows
* `--vm-driver=vmware` - VMware Fusion on OSX
* `--vm-driver=none` - Minikube running directly on a Linux® node without virtualization (this is not recommended on personal workstations)

The [Install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) page gives you more information on available VM driver options.

### Specifying the insecure registry

You must specify the `--insecure-registry` option to reference the Docker registry that is created. The `--insecure-registry` value is the same as specified in the  `daemon.json` file.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Because of a limitation in the current version of Minikube, adding the `--insecure-registry` option works on a new Minikube instance only.
If you start Minikube, be sure to run `minikube stop` and `minikube delete` before you start it again with the `--insecure-registry` option.

</InlineNotification>

### Specifying the Kubernetes version

You can override the version of Kubernetes that gets installed inside the Minikube VM by using the `--kubernetes-version` flag. This flag controls the compatibility between the client tools and the Kubernetes specification.

If you override the Kubernetes version, ensure that you download and install the corresponding version of `kubectl` - this version must be the same version as the Kubernetes cluster.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The `kubectl` version running locally and on Minikube should be compatible, so it's possible to use the `--kubernetes-version` flag to keep them consistent.

</InlineNotification>

## Docker registry

You need a registry to use docker images with Helm in Minikube.
There are different types of registries that can be used. However, this page describes a simple registry option that doesn't require extra components.

Minikube provides an add-on to run a registry in a container. For more information, see [How to access the Docker registry within minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/docker_registry/).

You can use the following command to enable the add-on:

```shell
minikube addons enable registry
```

When enabled, starting Minikube starts two pods on the `kube-system` namespace, named `registry` and `registry-proxy`. Now the registry is active and can be used. The registry points to the Minikube IP address on port 5000.

The containers don't mount any volumes, so stopping Minikube deletes the registry content.

## Hostname configuration for Minikube

This runbook uses a generic hostname of `minikube.local` as an example in commands and the configuration files.
You should add the Minikube IP address to the `hosts` file by using the generic hostname, or else modify the usage of `minikube.local` in this runbook to reflect your local hostname.

Where `minikube ip` is the command that returns the Minikube VM's IP address that is accessible from your workstation.

The local Docker client configuration must be also be updated with the corresponding IP address.

* Update the `daemon.json` docker configuration file with the Minikube IP address. This file is usually located in:
  * `~/.docker/daemon.json` on OSX
  * `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux
  * `C:\ProgramData\Docker\config\daemon.json` on Windows

Example of `daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "insecure-registries": [
    "192.168.0.0/16"
  ]
}
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** You can provide a specific IP address, or specify a subnet to future-proof the Docker client configuration.

</InlineNotification>

The Minikube IP address might change when you run `minikube delete`. If it changes, you must repeat these steps.

Therefore, reconfirm the Minikube IP and its setting in the `hosts` file every time you start Minikube, or after you run `minikube delete`.

## Minikube Ingress

Ingress is a reverse proxy, which sits in front of the application that is deployed in Kubernetes. It facilitates use of a custom domain name to access a deployed application, instead of using service ports.
To enable Ingress for Minikube, you must enable the `ingress` add-on.

```shell
minikube addons enable ingress
```

## Useful Minikube commands

Some useful Minikube commands are as follows:

```shell
# Sample commands
minikube status       # See if Minikube is running
minikube start        # Create and start Minikube
minikube dashboard    # Access the Kubernetes dashboard running within the Minikube cluster
minikube ssh          # Login into the Minikube VM
minikube addons list  # Show the status of the available add-ons
minikube stop         # Stop Minikube
minikube delete       # Delete the Minikube VM
minikube ip           # Show the Minikube IP
```
