description: Building base images from source

In some circumstances you may need to build your own base images, which can be accomplished using the steps below.

## IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ibmruntimes/ci.docker.git
  cd ci.docker/ibmjava/tests
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  ./build.sh ibm/ibmjava8:latest ../8/sdk/ubi-min
  ```

* (optional) Tag and Push the image to a private Docker registry:

  ```shell
  docker tag ibm/ibmjava8:latest $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/ibm/ibmjava8:latest
  docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/ibm/ibmjava8:latest
  ```

## S2I Core (required for Apache HTTP Server)

* Install pre-requisite packages:
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install go-md2man make`
  * CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install go-md2man make`
  * MacOS: `brew install bash coreutils go-md2man`
    * Reopen the terminal after installing these packages
    * Update the `PATH` variable to use the GNU version of commands that also exist on MacOS:

      ```shell
      export PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
      ```

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container.git
  cd s2i-base-container
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  make build TARGET=rhel8 VERSIONS=core
  ```

## Apache HTTP Server

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/httpd-container.git
  cd httpd-container
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  make tag TARGET=rhel8 VERSIONS=2.4
  ```

* (optional) Tag and Push the image to a private Docker registry:

  ```shell
  docker tag rhel8/httpd-24:latest $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/rhel8/httpd-24:latest
  docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/rhel8/httpd-24:latest
  ```
