**Note:** As of Release 20.7.0, the Helm version used to verify this runbook is 3.2. All the Helm commands that are used in this runbook are based on Helm v3.

</InlineNotification>

The [spm-kubernetes](https://github.com/IBM/spm-kubernetes) repository provides nine Helm charts:

* *apps:* defines how to deploy the IBM® WebSphere® Liberty images with the SPM application.
* *batch:* defines the batch image configuration.
* *uawebapp:* defines how to deploy the Universal Access (React) application.
* *web:* defines how to deploy the static content image for SPM (`Curam` image only).
* *mqserver:* defines the IBM WebSphere MQ image configuration.
* *openldap:* defines the OpenLDAP image configuration (used for session failover).
* *xmlserver:* defines the xmlserver container configuration.
* *spm:* an umbrella chart to contain all the other charts.

The charts use a templating mechanism to create the YAML file that is used by Kubernetes.
For this reason, the main configuration values are stored for each chart in a `values.yaml` file in the main folder of the charts.
The values can also be overwritten by the `spm:*` umbrella chart or by a provided override file during deployment as described in [Deploying Helm charts](/04-deployment/hc_deployment).

YAML is a human-readable structured data format. It provides powerful configuration settings, without having to learn a more complex code type like CSS, JavaScript, or PHP.

## Preparing to run the Helm charts

Before you run the charts, you must configure the database, configure IBM MQ, and test the charts.
You may also optionally integrate your deployment with an ISAM server for SSO enablement,
to do so please complete the steps on the [Enabling ISAM](/07-supporting-infrastructure/ISAM) page under Supporting Infrastructure before returning here.
Before you run the charts, you must configure the database, configure IBM MQ, and resolve all chart dependencies.

Many of the Helm charts that make up a deployment of SPM depend on the [IBM Shared Configuration Helpers](https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/samples/ibm-sch) chart, so an extra Helm repository must be added using the command below:

```shell
helm repo add sch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/samples
helm repo update
```

### Configuring the database

Update the Helm charts to point to the database that you installed in
[Install Prerequisite Software](/01-prereq/prereq).
The following values are provided in the  `values.yaml` files and must be modified before deployment to reflect your local environment:

```
global:
  database:
    type: "DB2"
    hostname: "dbhostname"
    dbName: "dbName"
    serviceName: ""
    username: "dbuser"
    spm_psw: "spmEncryptedDBPassword"
    wlp_psw: "xorEncodedDBPassword"
    port: 50000
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** To use an Oracle database, two changes are required:

* Change the `global.database.type` property value to `ORA`
* Set the `serviceName` property (corresponds to the `curam.db.oracle.servicename` property in Bootstrap.properties)

</InlineNotification>

All of the above values are required for a successful deployment.

`global.database.spm_psw` is equavalent to the `curam.db.password` property in `Bootstrap.properties`.
The value can be obtained by running `./build.sh encrypt -Dpassword=<password>` from any SPM installation.

`global.database.wlp_psw` is the WebSphere Liberty WebSphere `{xor}` encoding of the database password. The value can be obtained by using `$WLP_HOME/bin/securityUtility encode <password>`.

While it is possible to update the values directly in the `spm` chart, it is advisable to maintain a separate YAML file with values specific to your environment.
The YAML file will be used by the `helm install` command that is described in [Deploying Helm charts](/04-deployment/hc_deployment).

<InlineNotification>

You can find the full list of values available to override in `$SPM_HOME/helm-charts/spm/values.yaml`.

Sample override files for Minikube, IKS, and CRC are also available in the `$SPM_HOME/static/resources` folder.

### Configuring IBM MQ

IBM MQ is already configured to work out of the box with a secure connection with IBM WebSphere Liberty.
The commands that create all the objects that are needed on the queue manager are defined in a config map, in the `configmap-mqsc.yaml` file.

The password for the IBM MQ web console can be retrieved from the created Secret resource using the command below **after** it has been deployed:

```shell
kubectl get secret <releaseName>-mq-credentials -o go-template='{{.data.adminPasswordKey | base64decode}}{{"\n"}}'
```

### Configuring Batch heap size

The heap size of the batch processing can be adjusted by specifying the `batch.javaOptions` property within the values override file. The defaults are currently:

```
batch:
 javaOptions: "-Xms1g -Xmx1g"
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Kubernetes by default has limits set on resources such as memory and CPU usage. SPM containers require more resources than the default values that we have set.
We have set the default resource values to the limits that we have found to work best during development.

_The resource values are subject to change during further iterations._

The resource values can be changed. However, for troubleshooting, we will request that our default values are used at a minimum.

## Packaging the Helm charts

To use the Helm Charts to install SPM, package the charts and load them into a repository. For more information, see [ChartMuseum](/01-prereq/chartmuseum).

For each chart, its dependencies must be resolved before it can be loaded into a Helm repository like Chart museum.

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts

helm dependency update apps
helm dependency update mqserver
helm dependency update xmlserver
helm dependency update batch
helm dependency update web
helm dependency update uawebapp
```

If you made any changes to any of the charts, these can now be verified using the `helm lint` and `helm template` commands, for example:

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts

helm lint apps
helm template apps
```

To publish the individual charts to the Chart museum repository, run the following commands from the `helm-charts` folder. The commands also use the `$SPM_HOME` value that is defined in [Install prerequisite software](/01-prereq/git):

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts

helm push apps local-development
helm push mqserver local-development
helm push xmlserver local-development
helm push batch local-development
helm push web local-development
helm push uawebapp local-development
helm push openldap local-development

helm repo update
```

To generate the umbrella chart that is used for the deployment, run the following commands:

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts

helm dependency update spm
helm push spm local-development

helm repo update
```
