## Which cloud delivery model applies to IBM Cúram Social Program Management?

The most common cloud delivery models are Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
All other cloud delivery models (that is, Application Platform-as-a-Service, Database-as-a-Service, Security-as-a-Service, Container-as-a-Service etc.)
are specialized variations of one of the three main models. At this moment, only IaaS applies to SPM.

## How does Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) apply to SPM?

IaaS is a cloud delivery model that is used to host applications. Most typically, Cloud users self-serve servers over the internet to support their
development, test and production workloads without the intervention of a system administrator. Once provisioned, these servers are used to host the
middleware and the SPM application. In this model, software platform (PaaS) or final software (SaaS) are not delivered to end users over the internet
in a self-serve manner – the intervention of the system administrator is still required to install and configure all the middleware, integrate them,
deploy the application, and promote the application and data through the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Can we host SPM containers outside Kubernetes?

No. SPM does not support hosting of Docker containers outside Kubernetes, for example, Apache Mesos, AWS Elastic Container Services (ECS) or even
directly on virtual machines or bare metal.

## Can we use WebSphere Liberty Collectives on the architecture?

No. SPM does not support WebSphere Liberty Collectives, regardless of the deployment architecture. Although WebSphere Liberty
provides support to Collectives, SPM does not support a deployment architecture of the SPM application on WebSphere Liberty Collectives.
