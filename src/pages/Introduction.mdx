IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) was enhanced in version 7.0.10.0 to enable it to be deployed on cloud native hosting platforms.
While SPM could be cloud hosted in a IaaS cloud delivery model, this model cannot leverage the benefits of flexibility, elasticity, efficiency
and the strategic value that is offered by cloud native architecture.

SPM was further enhanced in 7.0.11.0 to support RedHat OpenShift Container Platform.

Since version 7.0.11.0 SPM supports Red Hat OpenShift, and this runbook describes how to use CodeReady Containers (CRC) for development purposes.
