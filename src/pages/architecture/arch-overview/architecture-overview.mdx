Figure 1 shows how SPM is built as a containerized application by using WebSphere® Application Server Liberty, packaged as Docker®
containers, orchestrated by Helm, and running on IKS.

**Note:** Database support and MQ support remains on virtual machines (VMs) as part of the initial offering.

To support containerized architectures, a number of architectural changes were made. The changes are documented below and apply only to SPM running on
Kubernetes.

* [Message Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubJMSArchitecture.html)
  When IBM® Cúram Social Program Management is containerized, IBM MQ Long Term Support (LTS) is used as the message engine to process internal application
  JMS-based deferred processing.
* [Transaction Isolation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubThreadIsolation.html)
  Client HTTP initiated transactions and JMS initiated transactions run on different WebSphere Application Server Liberty instances, integrated through
  an external message engine (for example, IBM MQ).
* [Elasticity](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubElasticity.html)
  Elasticity in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is the ability to scale up or down pods and nodes to adjust to the load to meet the end user demand.
