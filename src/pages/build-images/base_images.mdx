description: Building base images from source
---

Some of the images built in the next section, [Building the Docker® images](/build-images/build_images) require authentication with the RedHat Container Registry.
If you do not have an active Red Hat Subscription you will need to build these images from source instead. If you do have an appropriate subscription and do not wish to build from source, please continue to [Building the Docker® image](/build-images/build_images).
If you do need to build from source, you can do so with the following steps.

## IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ibmruntimes/ci.docker.git
  cd ci.docker/ibmjava/tests
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  ./build.sh ibm/ibmjava8-sdk-ubi8-minimal:latest ../8/sdk/ubi-min
  ```

* (optional) Tag and Push the image to a private Docker registry:

  ```shell
  docker tag ibm/ibmjava8-sdk-ubi8-minimal:latest $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/ibm/ibmjava8-sdk-ubi8-minimal:latest
  docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/ibm/ibmjava8-sdk-ubi8-minimal:latest
  ```

## S2I Core (required for Apache HTTP Server)

* Install pre-requisite packages:
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install go-md2man make`
  * CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install go-md2man make`
  * MacOS: `brew install bash coreutils go-md2man`
    * Reopen the terminal after installing these packages
    * Update the `PATH` variable to use the GNU version of commands that also exist on MacOS:

      ```shell
      export PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
      ```

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container.git
  cd s2i-base-container
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  make build TARGET=rhel8 VERSIONS=core
  ```

## Apache HTTP Server

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/httpd-container.git
  cd httpd-container
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  make tag TARGET=rhel8 VERSIONS=2.4
  ```

* (optional) Tag and Push the image to a private Docker registry:

  ```shell
  docker tag rhel8/httpd-24:latest $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/rhel8/httpd-24:latest
  docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/my-library/rhel8/httpd-24:latest
  ```
