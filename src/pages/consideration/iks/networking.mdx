## Networking

Kubernetes is all about sharing machines between applications and dynamic port allocation brings a lot of complications to the system. This can work in different ways. [Network Policies
](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies) in kubernetes can take form in [Cluster Networking](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters) or [Ingress](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress).

Ingress works by exposing HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.
