<InlineNotification>

**Note:** As of Release 20.7.0, the Helm version used to verify this runbook is 3.2. All the Helm commands that are used in this runbook are based on Helm v3.

</InlineNotification>

When the Helm charts are uploaded to the repository, you can deploy the application by using one of the following commands:

```shell
# Helm v3 ('releasename' is mandatory for Helm v3)
helm install releasename local-development/spm
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: releasename should contain no capital letters.

</InlineNotification>

Where `releasename` is the name of this Helm release. For example, MyRelease-1.0.
If you do not specify a name, Helm auto generates one. All the names of the Kubernetes objects are created with `releasename-` as prefix.

The `helm install` command installs the Helm charts in the order in which they were loaded in the repository, with all the values defined in the files.
However, as described in [Setting up the Docker® context](/build-images/setup_docker_context), you can override the configuration value by running the following shell script:

```shell
# Helm v3
helm install releasename local-development/spm -f override-values.yaml
```

### Sample `override-values.yaml` files

Here are three sample override files for deploying.

* [Minikube](/resources/minikube-values.yaml)
* [CodeReady Containers](/resources/crc-values.yaml)
* [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](/resources/iks-values.yaml)

<InlineNotification>

**Note on IKS overrides:**

* The full image name is based on the `registry`, `imageLibrary`, `imagePrefix`, and `imageTag` keys nested under `global.images` as follows:
  * `{registry}/{imageLibrary}/{imagePrefix}curam:{imageTag}`
  * With the given values, the resulting image name will look like this: `us.icr.io/foo-library/test_curam:latest`
* IAM credentials for the [IBM Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-registry) (`global.imagePullSecret`) must be provided.
* The [Application Load Balancer IDs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress_annotation#alb-id) (`ingress.annotations."ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID"`) must be provided for the Ingress resource to be created correctly.

</InlineNotification>

The license agreements for the IBM® WebSphere® Liberty and IBM WebSphere MQ images must be accepted in order to proceed with the deployment of these elements. This can be done by setting the `global.license` property to `accept`.

The respective license agreements can be reviewed by running the following commands:

```shell
# IBM WebSphere Liberty
docker run --rm -e LICENSE=view websphere-liberty:20.0.0.9-full-java8-ibmjava

# IBM WebSphere MQ
docker run --rm -e LICENSE=view ibmcom/mq:9.1.3.0
```

## Status of the system

The `helm install` command shows all the Kubernetes objects and also runs the SPM containers. You can track the status of the SPM containers on real time by running the following command:

```shell
kubectl get pods -w

NAME                                              READY  STATUS    RESTARTS  AGE
releasename-apps-curam-consumer-595c8bf95f-zn2l5  0/1    Init 3/4  0         5m
releasename-apps-curam-producer-6b5569c4ff-nvxtd  1/1    Running   0         5m
releasename-apps-rest-consumer-85b4865b9d-wr6hj   0/1    Init 3/4  0         5m
releasename-apps-rest-producer-cd8fdbbbf-j2mjj    0/1    Init 3/4  0         5m
releasename-uawebapp-7cdd64987-qx8l8                1/1    Running   0         5m
releasename-web-67697ffb8b-fdsk2                  1/1    Running   0         5m
releasename-mqserver-curam-7f45bcd64d-rlqns       1/1    Running   0         5m
releasename-mqserver-rest-544c5b4758-pnbpz        1/1    Running   0         5m
releasename-xmlserver-77d6d9b75d-4xr8k            1/1    Running   0         5m

```

The command lists the pods and their status, where each status change is on a new line.

Some of the pods have initialization steps, so they are not shown until the steps are completed.

The output of the `kubectl get pods` command provides the names of the pods that you can use to substitute for `podname` in the following example commands.
For example, the Liberty pod that contains SPM code is a name that uses a pattern of: `releasename-apps-curam-`.

You can also describe a pod by running the following command:

```shell
kubectl describe pod/pod name
```

You can also read the log when the status is `running`, by running the following command:

```shell
kubectl logs -f pod/podname
```

## Accessing the application

To access the application, a URL is provided to access the pod within the cluster. This access is provided using Ingress resources on Kubernetes, and Routes resources on OpenShift.
