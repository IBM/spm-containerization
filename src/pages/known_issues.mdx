## Minikube dashboard command on Red Hat

When you follow the steps`Kubernetes dashboard` in [Monitoring the application](/monitoring/interrogate_runtime), the `minikube dashboard` command might not work on Red Hat operating systems.
For more information, see [Minikube issue 5815](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/5815).

## Using Helm on Red Hat

When you use Helm on Red Hat, you might have to use the LinuxÂ® `yum` command to install the `socat` utility. Otherwise, Tiller does not work properly.

## Context Root Not Found error on the SPM home page, BIRT, or caseload summary pages

The `Context Root Not Found` error occurs because the deployment does not install the BIRT application.

## The logs are filled by repetitions of the ICWWKS4001I message

For example:

```
[1/22/19 8:48:18:272 GMT] 000000ba com.ibm.ws.security.token.internal.TokenManagerImpl ICWWKS4001I: The security token cannot be validated. This can be for the following reasons:
1. The security token was generated on another server using different keys.
2. The token configuration or the security keys of the token service that created the token has been changed.
3. The token service that created the token is no longer available.
```

The root cause is users not clearing the browser cache after the application is redeployed. Users might have old, local cookie files.

However, after a redeployment or an upgrade, the application does not recognize the cookies that are presented to it by the computer, which causes the error messages in the logs.

## Limitations when using the Minikube none driver

There are a number of limitations associated with the Minikube none driver that are documented in [Minikube documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/none/).
You must evaluate the impacts of these limitations for your implementation.

However, the unavailability of the `minikube ssh` command might make it difficult to analyze and resolve problems and issues. For example, switching to the kvm2 driver enables the use of `minikube ssh` and resolves issues with the Docker Registry.

## Storage initialized using a runbook version older than 20.9.0

If storage has been initialized using a version of the runbook older than 20.9.0, you will need to update your
override values to include a supplementary group:

```yaml
global:
  mq:
    security:
      context:
        supplementalGroups: [888]
```

This is due to a update in IBM MQ, the details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/charts/blob/master/stable/ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev/RELEASENOTES.md).

## IBM MQ XAER_PROTO issue

The following issue has been observed in the JMS Consumer pods when JMS transactions is processed by a newly deployed pod, at the initial JMS transactions. The exception in thrown by the IBM MQ Resource Adapter.

```
[INFO    ] FFDC1015I: An FFDC Incident has been created: "javax.transaction.xa.XAException: The method 'xa_start' has failed with errorCode '-6'. com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.JTAXAResourceImpl.start 307" at ...
[INFO    ] FFDC1015I: An FFDC Incident has been created: "javax.transaction.xa.XAException: The method 'xa_start' has failed with errorCode '-6'. com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.RegisteredResources.startRes 1053" at ...
[ERROR   ] WTRN0078E: An attempt by the transaction manager to call start on a transactional resource has resulted in an error.
The error code was XAER_PROTO. The exception stack trace follows: javax.transaction.xa.XAException: The method 'xa_start' has failed with errorCode '-6'.
	at com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiXAResource.start(JmqiXAResource.java:980)
	at com.ibm.mq.connector.xa.XARWrapper.start(XARWrapper.java:680)
	at com.ibm.ws.Transaction.JTA.JTAResourceBase.start(JTAResourceBase.java:121)
	at [internal classes]
	at com.ibm.mq.connector.inbound.AbstractWorkImpl.run(AbstractWorkImpl.java:210)
	at com.ibm.ws.jca.inbound.security.JCASecurityContextService.runInInboundSecurityContext(JCASecurityContextService.java:49)
	at [internal classes]
```

The issue does not affect the state of the Queue Manager. It does not disrupt the connection between the JMS Consumer pods and IBM MQ Queue Manager nor the ability of JMS Consumer to process JMS messages.
