As of Release 20.7.0, the IKS version used to verify this runbook is 1.18.

</InlineNotification>

For the implementation of this runbook we used Minikube.

In future releases we will aim to have this implementation on IKS.

The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) provides an isolated and secure platform for managing containers.

Master node - worker nodes are managed by a Kubernetes master node that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster. The master node is managed by IBM.

For more details, see [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service/).

**Important!**

Note that the free trial is not suitable for this implementation. But it can used as a sandbox to explore Kubernetes.
