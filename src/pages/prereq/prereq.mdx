IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) has been enhanced in version 7.0.10.0 to enable it to be deployed on cloud native hosting platforms.
To build and run IBM Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) for Kubernetes, install the following software components:

* [Base third-party software](/prereq/3rdparty-sw)
* [IBM Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) software](/deploy-spm/SPM-sw)
* [Docker®, and Helm](/prereq/docker-helm)
* [Kubernetes](/prereq/kubernetes/kubernetes-overview)
  * [Minikube](/prereq/kubernetes/minikube)
* [Code Ready Container](/prereq/openshift/codeready-containers)
* [ChartMuseum](/prereq/chartmuseum)
* [GitHub repo](/prereq/git)

In order to be hosted on Kubernetes, IBM Cúram Social Program Management has been enhanced to support the following technologies:
