The Kubernetes object that is being created by using the code in this repository is a Cron job, which is scheduled to run every 15 minutes.
Therefore, initially no pod is listed, but a pod is started after 15 minutes and is visible when you run the `kubectl get pods` command.

The pod runs the standard command `build runbatch` that is described in [Running the Batch Launcher](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.content.doc/Operations/c_COPSGUIDE_Processes2RunningBatchLauncher1.html).

At the end of the execution, the pod stops but is not destroyed and a new pod is created after another 15 minutes. Access the log by running the `kubectl logs pod/podname` command.

You can delete the pod by running the `kubectl delete pod/podname` command.
