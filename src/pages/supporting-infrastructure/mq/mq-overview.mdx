IBM MQ is a queue managing service from the IBM stack. To support Kubernetes, changes to SPM were required. For more information on these changes, see
[Kubernetes Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubArchitecture.html) section in
the Knowledge Center.  

When SPM is containerized on Kubernetes, it uses IBM MQ to manage JMS messages for Cúram Deferred Processes and Cúram Workflows. For more information about MQ, see [About IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.1.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q001010_.htm).

If MQ fails, certain functionality will be unusable. This includes and is not limited to, creation of a case and creation of an application. In order to reduce the likelihood
of this, MQ can be configured to be a multi-instance deployment. This results in a stateful set being created, with one active/primary queue manager, and one standby/secondary queue manager.

Currently, MQ can be configured on [IKS](/supporting-infrastructure/mq/mq-on-iks) or [OpenShift](/supporting-infrastructure/mq/mq-on-openshift).
