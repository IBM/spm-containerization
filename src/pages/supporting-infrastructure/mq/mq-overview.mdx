To support Kubernetes, changes to SPM were required.
For more information on these changes, see
[Kubernetes Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubArchitecture.html) section in
the Knowledge Center.

When SPM is containerized on Kubernetes, it uses IBM® MQ to manage JMS messages for Cúram Deferred Processes and Cúram Workflows. IBM MQ is a queue managing service from the IBM stack. For more information about MQ, see [About IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.1.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q001010_.htm).

If MQ fails, certain functionality will be unusable. This includes and is not limited to, creation of a case and creation of an application.

The MQ Cluster set up requires two queue managers nodes, with one active/primary queue manager, and one standby/secondary queue manager.
